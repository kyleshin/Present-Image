# Tap To Present Image- iOS Sample

An iOS sample app demonstrating tapping an image to present it in full screen mode.
The presentation is animated(non-interactive), and the dismissal is animated and interactive. All view controller transition animations are custom. It looks similar to how Twitter handles tap image presentation in their iOS app.


The iOS techniques presented here are:
* Getting a resized image to be presented in the imageView.
* Custom view controller transition animation - interactive and non-interactive.
